I am going to be 58 in June. Why now am I only beginning education for a chosen career? I know now that as good as I was as an administrator, it wasn't enough for me mentally. I was always thinking more than I needed to for those jobs. At most, I would prevail with my in-depth approach to tasks by providing or inspiring an innovation. Sometimes I was applauded. More often, I would be judged as being obstreporous and stepping on the toes of superiors.

The impetus was the loss of my last job due to an illness and the organizations inability to enable me back into the fold by providing an modified environment where I could thrive after 11 years on the job and coming down with an autoimmune disease that is a chronic condition. Oooch, that hurt. But I move on. I work more on my health and need to find employment.
I apply for jobs in the same category for the same organizations and for a few that I could see a fit and make a comprable salary. Months go by, my savings are being spent, and I am unsuccessful in securing employment. In that search, my eye caught sight of an ad for women in tech. A chance for women to have a career with a school that would provide the education in a short period of time and with a scholarship. I think to myself that had I had a chance like this as early as right after high school, that I would have grabbed it. I have always been drawn to technology and how things work and detecting and creating. Hence, coding.
