<p>I am a mature professional women who has recently worked at a University as a Graduate Program & Web Administrator. Due to an illness, I lost my job. After pursuing job opportunities, I found that I needed another plan. The Flatiron School's Women in Tech opportunity sounded right up my alley. I have been technically inclined since the beginning of PC's when they were more like terminals. There was no Microsoft Office. I also think that  if I had been given the option, I probably would have become a coder right from out of high school. So here goes on my journey to become a coder and find a different kind of job.</p>
